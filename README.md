# IntelliKiosk 7.0

One upon a time (circa October 2014) in a land far far away (San Francisco, CA) I used to spend all of my spare time working on personal coding projects.  On of my favorite projects was IntelliKiosk.  It's probably the most ambitions side project that I've built to date.  There have been five versions of this monolith (this was back before I was introduced to the beauty of microservices). Although I wouldn't necessarily write code today the way I did back then, it's still one of my favorite projects.  Maybe one day I will completely rebuild it using ReactJs, Node, etc.  But for now it remains as a warm reminder of many sleepliness nights and my obsession with writing code and building intuitive user experiences.

Ok nice intro, but what is it?

Version 7.0 was two big pieces:  A content management system for building and managing multiple websites and an admin application for managing users, error handling, and other fancy administrative stuff.
